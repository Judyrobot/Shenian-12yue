# Underwater Optical Docking Based on YOLO Detection

This repository contains the implementation of an underwater optical docking system for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs).  
The project integrates **YOLO-based optical beacon detection**, **geometric pose estimation for docking**, and **light propagation simulation** for algorithm validation.

The codebase is designed to support **experimental reproduction** and **engineering-oriented research**, rather than a fully autonomous control system.

## System Overview

The overall processing pipeline is:


1. **Beacon Detection (YOLO)**  
   A lightweight YOLO-based detector identifies beacon positions in image coordinates.

2. **Pose Estimation (`docking/`)**  
   The detected beacon layout is matched against a predefined geometric configuration to estimate:
   - Relative position
   - Relative orientation (yaw / pitch / roll if applicable)

3. **Light Simulation (Optional)**  
   The `Lightsimulation/` module provides synthetic optical data for algorithm validation under controlled underwater conditions.

## Docking Pose Estimation (`docking/`)

The `docking` folder contains the core docking algorithm:

- Input:
  - 2D image coordinates of detected beacons
  - Camera intrinsic parameters
  - Known beacon layout geometry

- Output:
  - Estimated relative pose of the AUV with respect to the docking station

The algorithm focuses on **robust geometric consistency** rather than complex optimization, making it suitable for real-time onboard deployment.
